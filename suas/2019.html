    <h1>AUVSI Competition Overview</h1>
    <div class="autogen-md">The <a href="http://www.auvsi-suas.org/">AUVSI competition</a> is an annual mock
        search-and-rescue autonomous drone competition held in Pautuxent River, MD on the Webster Naval Air Base. The
        competition is typically held in the middle of June, unfortunately during Spring Quarter Finals. The competition
        changes slightly between the years, but for the most part it has several main objects from year-to-year:<br>*
        Autonomous Takeoff, Flight, and Landing* Image Detection, Localization, & Classification* Obstacle Avoidance*
        Payload Drop<br></div>
