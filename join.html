      is any aircraft without a human pilot on board, which typically operate
      under various degrees of <strong>robotic autonomy</strong>. These types of
      systems originated mostly in military applications, but have since
      expanded into
      <strong>commercial, scientific, recreational, and agricultural</strong>
      sectors of the economy.

      UAS@UCLA is a group of hardworking, cross-disciplinary, and naturally
      curious students, driven to innovate and learn in the field of
      aeronautics. With a focus on hands-on learning, we immediately put new
      members into high impact projects that not only challenge them, but give
      them the opportunity to learn far more than they would in any formal
      training program. We strongly believe the club's purpose is for students
      to learn as much as possible, while still having fun, and creating a
      strong sense of community around a shared passion.

    <p>
      UAS@UCLA provides a unique chance for students of all background to work
      on exciting and innovative projects. From computer vision to mechanical
      challenges, our ambitious set of upcoming projects encompasses a wide
      range of opportunities to learn more about autonomous systems, while also
      contributing to a meaningful and interesting project. Our subteam
      structure provides close support to our members, quickly preparing members
      to contribute to our projects without a lengthy training process. In the
      past, we have worked on

      >, <a href="/aviata">NASA-sponsored research projects</a>,

      <a href="/docs">more</a>.

    <!-- <p>
      For students only interested in flying drones, the
      <a href="/allfly">AllFly</a> program provides the parts, guidance, and
      training to learn to assemble and fly an autonomous drone without any
      previous technical experience.

      This is <strong>the same signup that we have out at the NSO</strong> (New
      Student Orientation), <strong>EAF</strong> (Enormous Activities Fair),
      <strong>and EWD</strong> Engineering Welcome Day -- If you sign up at
      either of those events, you&#39;re all set! If you are not sure whether or
      not you filled out the form, or otherwise came across our website in
      another way, just sign up above and we&#39;ll get you on the email list.
