        <strong>g.</strong> prefix is NOT required.

    </p>
    <p>Every student should have a UCLA email (typically something like ucla_login@ucla.edu). To check your email, go to
        gmail.com and sign in (with ucla_login@<strong>g</strong>.ucla.edu as the username). Information for how to do
        this is <a href="https://g.ucla.edu">available here</a>.</p>
    <p>In the event that you would like to use a different email or are having trouble with your campus email, please
        use the contact form at the bottom of our <a href="/">homepage</a> and request to be added to our Slack channel
        (using the email field as the email you intend to use).</p>

    <h2 id="channels-and-direct-messages">Channels and Direct Messages</h2>
    <p>Channels on Slack are used to distinguish communication on different projects. UAS@UCLA has adopted the following
        default channels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1_announcements:</strong> Announcements from the team leads</li>
        <li><strong>1_general:</strong> General discussion about team-related stuff</li>
        <li><strong>1_memes:</strong> Dank memes</li>
        <li><strong>2_airframe:</strong> Airframe subteam discussion</li>
        <li><strong>2_business:</strong> Business/club finance discussion</li>
        <li><strong>3_careers:</strong> Info about career opportunities</li>
        <li><strong>4_auvsi2_2021-2:</strong> Discussion about our AUVSI Competition Project</li>
        <li><strong>4_ieee_competition:</strong> Discussion about our IEEE Competition Project</li>
        <li><strong>4_nasa_usrc-2:</strong> Discussion about our NASA USRC Project</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Everyone who joins our Slack workspace gets added to these channels automatically. Because of this, we don&#39;t
        recommend spamming them too much, since everyone on the team will get a notification. For more specific
        discussions, please create a separate channel and invite only the people that need to be in the discussion.</p>
    <p>If you can&#39;t find information about the project or program you are looking for, are interested in more
        specific team information, or are just curious, click on <strong>Add channels-&gt;Browse all channels</strong>
        to view all public Slack channels.</p>
    <p>In addition, to contact one of our team leads, use the <strong>Direct Message</strong> feature and type in their
        name. Use our convenient <a href="/members">Members</a> webpage to identify who is who!</p>
    <h2 id="accessing-slack-from-everywhere">Accessing Slack from everywhere</h2>
    <p>Slack has an <a href="https://slack.com/downloads/ios">iOS</a> and <a
            href="https://slack.com/downloads/android">Android</a> app that you can download to stay on top of
        everything going on within our team, in addition to other organizations that you are also signed up for on
        Slack. In addition, there are <a href="https://slack.com/downloads/mac">Mac</a> and <a
            href="https://slack.com/downloads/windows">Windows</a> desktop apps that can run directly on your computer.
    </p>
    <h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2>
    <p>We highly recommend downloading the Slack application on your phone &amp; enabling all notifications to stay on
        top of everything. Due to the size of our team, we cannot verify that everyone has their notifications set up
        correctly, so it is up to each individual person to set it up as they wish. At a minimum, make sure you are
        getting all notifications for our <strong>#1_announcements</strong> channel.
