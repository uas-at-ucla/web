    <h1 id="project-description">Project Description</h1>
    <p>We're developing the <strong>Autonomous Vehicle Infinite Air Time Apparatus</strong>, or <strong>AVIATA</strong>:
        a system that will be capable of carrying payloads in the air indefinitely. To do this, we plan to use a drone
        swarm to hold a central frame supporting the payload, allowing us to swap individual drones in and out whenever
        they run low on battery. With this design, AVIATA will have the reliability and versatility to assist in
        emergency relief, environmental monitoring, and supply transportation.</p>
    <p>Our proposal has been accepted by the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) in the <a
            href="https://nari.arc.nasa.gov/usrc">University Student Research Challenge (USRC)</a>. More than that,
        we&#39;re motivated by our project's potential impact: AVIATA is the first of its kind, achieving endless flight
        time with a compact system that can be quickly manufactured and delivered. Aviation technology is progressing
        rapidly, and it is our hope that AVIATA will help influence and define the next breakthroughs in autonomous
        flight.</p>

    <p>As of September 18th, 2020, we&#39;ve started a blog on this website for writing periodic updates on this
        research project! The full list of posts can be found on the <a href="/aviata/blog.html">AVIATA Blogs</a> page.</p>
    <h1 id="preliminary-design-review-pdr-">Preliminary Design Review (PDR)</h1>
    <p>Our AVIATA team presented our initial conceptual designs to a panel of UCLA engineering faculty and alumni on
        October 30, 2020. We received great feedback and suggestions before we began acquiring materials and equipment
        to test fly drones.</p>

    <p>Our AVIATA team presented our project with subsystem specific tests, data, and analysis to a panel of UCLA
        engineering faculty and alumni on February 19, 2021. We acquired very useful feedback and suggestions for our
        next steps towards integrating the subsystems together.</p>

    <p>Three of our senior team leads presented AVIATA to an audience of NASA engineers and researchers at the USRC Tech
        Talk session on June 14, 2021. Here we showcased the initial testing of the intermediary four-drone frame and
        the successful docking procedure using computer vision.</p>
