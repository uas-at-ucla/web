    <h1>Hardware Design</h1>
    <h3>Author: James Tseng</h3>
    <div class="autogen-md">We at Unmanned Aerial Systems at UCLA welcome the new year, and are very excited looking
        forward to pushing ahead with our projects!<br>In the mechanical airframe sub-team, we have most recently been
        looking into sourcing our drone fleet. In our initial proposal and designs, we are using hobbyist hexacopters,
        particularly the F550 model, which had used to be produced by DJI, and has since been taken over by 3rd parties
        since DJI discontinued them. This has been one of the issues with finding a quality and reputable supply, as
        supply is both rare and expensive that fits our specifications.<br>Since we are outfitting our drones with
        additional equipment such as a Raspberry Pi and our custom docking mount, as well as being able to lift the
        payload frame, we need a stronger propulsion system. In switching our onboard battery design to 4S (16V), the
        drones can achieve satisfactory performance.<br>This has since been our main focus as both the controls and
        docking sub-teams are nearly ready to begin hardware testing with cooperative control and computer vision
        tracking, respectively. Another mechanical airframe subteam involvement with these endeavors has been the design
        of a mounting adapter that connects two drones together through carbon fiber tubes to test the minimum
        cooperative control setup.<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/aviata/aviata-control-testing-frame.png"
                style="width: 60%;" /></div><br><b><i>Figure 1:</b> Two different mount designs to connect two drones
        with carbon fiber spars to test minimum cooperative control.</i><br>Our next goal is to finalize our drone fleet
        design, order them, and assemble them. As a priority, we will first be figuring out shipping the current drones
        we have on hand to the sub-teams to conduct their testing. These tests are preparing us for our CDR (Critical
        Design Review) this quarter, before we begin integrating each sub-team's subsystem for our tech demo hopefully
        in June!<br></div>
    <h1>Software Design</h1>
    <h3>Author: Ryan Nemiroff</h3>
    <div class="autogen-md">The software team has been hard at work writing code for each subsystem and testing via
        simulation. We have successfully demonstrated distributed control as well as vision-guided flight using
        simulated AprilTags. Mesh networking needs a little more tweaking before we can fully test it, so stay tuned for
        when that happens.<br>Firstly, here is the distributed control simulation, demonstrating a leader drone
        commanded to takeoff and land (left), and a follower drone copying its attitude & thrust commands (right).
        Communication is implemented via ROS2.<br>
        <div style="text-align:center"><iframe
                src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16wvXjV1I5ccTXp6uFZZBnz5HPnasDfZd/preview" width="640"
                height="480"></iframe></div><br>And here is our docking simulation, with the 3D world shown on the left
        and what the drone sees from its perspective on the right as it approaches the AprilTags.<div
            style="text-align:center"><iframe
                src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xj-eDURRgNj87oSIXgvovkN8C68XPoGe/preview" width="640"
                height="360"></iframe></div><br>Obviously, this is a long way from our final product. One limitation of
        the available simulation tools is the inability to connect multiple vehicles in a rigid body (and it's already
        very computationally intensive). Previously, we had simulated this using a simplified model which did not
        incorporate the actual flight software. To put these things together, there is hardware on the way which will
        allow the first real-world test of cooperative control. The temporary test structure using two drones is shown
        in this week's hardware blog.<br>Potentially, the full rigid structure could be simulated along with the flight
        software, but this would require significant modification of the already complex simulation tools. Because we
        are able to conduct real-world tests, the benefit of simulation is not very appealing given the cost of
        implementation.<br>We are in anticipation of the results of this first real-world controls test, which will
        inform us if and how we should implement alternative control methods -- there are many potential ways to
        accomplish cooperative control, and we want performance to guide our decision on which to use.<br>
