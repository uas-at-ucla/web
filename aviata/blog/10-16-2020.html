    <h2>Software Design</h2>
    <h3>Author: Ryan Nemiroff</h3>
    <div class="autogen-md">With our first design review two weeks away, the AVIATA team has progressed in designing and
        testing elements of the software system. We've conducted real-world tests to gain a practical understanding of
        our vision system's ability to identify image targets. We are also progressing towards being able to simulate
        and benchmark various mesh networking algorithms for drone communication.Although we have not written any flight
        code yet, we are busy designing and developing simulation techniques to ensure that flight will be as reliable
        as possible. We have developed a drone control & physics simulator in Python, that currently reflects a
        simplified model of the physics of drone flight. We are able to control the motors and calculate the resultant
        forces on the AVIATA structure, which so far has given us basic confidence that our current hardware selections
        are feasible. Next, we will be adding a simulated control system, which will give us the ability to analyze how
        the system might act in real flight. This will inform our decisions on how to allocate control to the motors,
        and tell us what scenarios the structure can safely operate in.<br><img src=/assets/aviata/simulator.png

        represents a propeller, with its color indicating the motor speed._<br>We are itching to begin writing the
        AVIATA flight code, but we can't do it without preliminary testing of our ideas, which is why all these
        simulations are so important! Another preparation we've made is planning out the overall logic flow of the
        system, which is a tough design challenge due to all the physically-separated moving parts. Below is a taste of
        our logic diagrams, which we will refine as needed to support all modes of operation.<br><img src=/assets/aviata/logic.png

    <h2>Hardware Design</h2>
    <h3>Author: James Tseng</h3>
    <div class="autogen-md">Since the last two weeks, our Mechanical Airframe have been focusing our attention on four
        major issues to resolve: the strength of the carbon fiber, configuring the Apriltag on the frame, the structure
        of the payload frame, and figuring out how to onboard the new members of our club onto this team.<br>We had
        decided on designing the octagon payload frame with twin rods of carbon fiber as the perimeter, as opposed to
        one thicker carbon fiber tube. This decision was made mostly due to the low price factor of the specific 0.548‚Äù
        carbon fiber tubes. I conducted a stress test by experimenting with weights hanging on one side of the tubes
        clamped to one side, creating an end loaded cantilever beam scenario. Multiple measurements were taken and the
        bulk modulus of elasticity was calculated to be 1.09 GPa for the carbon fiber tubes in parallel. This value was
        lower than we had anticipated, and thus led to the decision to increase the diameter of the carbon tubes of the
        frame.<br>Another concern we had was the effects of having a large, centralized Apriltag located in the middle
        of the frame and the aerodynamic effects this would cause, as well as the method of mounting it to the frame.
        One suggested idea was to place the large Apriltag on a screen mesh to allow air to flow through this large
        surface. Team member Bhrugu was able to test this idea with a smaller filter, and saw promising
        results.<br>However, the main issue arose with the consideration of mounting this Apriltag to the frame. To
        place the tag in the center of the frame without increasing weight significantly, we considered pulling taut
        fishing wires to support the tag. However, we would have to devise a similar solution for the payload attachment
        that would also be mounted in the center of the frame. From here, the team decided to revert our payload frame
        design to a more traditional spoke design which makes mounting both the Apriltag and the payload much simpler,
        at the possible expense of additional weight. We are considering conducting a trade study to determine which
        would be optimal.<br>Finally, as we have started a new quarter, we are excited to welcome our new students
        interested in UAS@UCLA. We are planning ways to incorporate tasks so that they can gain some new experience
        while not being overwhelmed by these unfamiliar and possibly challenging tasks. Part of the plan is to hold
        office hours for them to drop by and ask any questions or ask for help, or even just to socialize among us as a
        club. Being involved with a hands-on engineering project is tough in this current setting, but we hope to make
        progress the best we can.<br></div>
