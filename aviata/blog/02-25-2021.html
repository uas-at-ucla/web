    <h1>Update #9: February 25, 2021 </h1>
    <h2>Software Design</h2>
    <h3>Author: Puneet Nayyar</h3>
    <div class="autogen-md">Since our last update, each of the software teams have officially begun physical testing.
        After spending so much time implementing our designs in simulation, we finally had the opportunity to run our
        code on physical drones and get a better idea of our progress and future areas to focus on.<br>To test our
        cooperative control software, we rigidly connected two drones and were able to have a leader drone successfully
        send attitude setpoints to a follower and demonstrate a position hold.<br>One of Ryan's videos:<br>
        <div style="text-align:center"><iframe
                src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F1gabOHSMQpjT5iPG4fChp8tstxiRRBR/preview" width="640"
                height="480"></iframe></div><br>The docking team also started testing the preliminary portions of the
        docking process. We successfully had a Raspberry Pi mounted on the drone activate offboard mode and send
        velocity setpoints to takeoff and land autonomously. In addition, the camera on the drone relayed a video stream
        to the RPi in which we were able to detect the AprilTag placed on the ground.<br>Here is a picture from the
        camera on-board the drone during this docking testing procedure, where we can clearly see the target that the
        drone detected:<br>

        <br>On the communications side, we tested sending and receiving data in a setup with three nodes and were able
        to get quantitative results on delay time and packet loss rate.<br>Some of Yuchen's test results, showing that
        networking and packet delay times are within acceptable bounds:<br>

        <br>We also presented our progress and the results of these tests at our Critical Design Review last week to
        alumni and faculty and received great feedback and helpful pointers for the future. We'll be spending the next
        few weeks incorporating that feedback and continuing our testing. Some next steps include PID tuning, mesh
        network incorporation, and autonomous navigation to a vision target.<br>
