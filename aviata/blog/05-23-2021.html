    <h1>Update #12: May 23, 2021 </h1>
    <h2>Airframe</h2>
    <h3>Author: James Tseng</h3>
    <div class="autogen-md">Since the last update, the Airframe team has been working on three tasks as we progress
        nearing the end of Spring Quarter.<br>First, the Airframe team finalized and 3D printed a practice docking mount
        for the Docking team to test the accuracy of their docking PID tuning, since previously the drone simply was
        tested to land on the target on the ground.<br>
        <div style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/aviata/docking_mechanism.jpg" style="width: 30%;" /></div><br>This
        design and the cone adapter will be the final shape of the docking mechanism, which is currently only missing
        the latching keys that will ensure the dock and drone rigidly attach, and the mount to secure onto the carbon
        fiber arms of the frame.<br>The Docking team has been successful in landing a drone into the docking cone, which
        will be elaborated on in the software section. How exciting!<br>The second task currently on hand is to finalize
        the docking mechanism. This includes the key inserts that lock the drone to the frame, which is actuated by
        servo rotation. The key actuation, shown in its extended and retracted positions, are shown below.<br>
        <div style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/aviata/docking_mech_cad.png" style="width: 60%;" /></div><br>The
        docking keys, linkage arms, and the cylinder will be 3D printed and connected with metal screws and inserts.
        While a 3D printed linkage is not ideal, we decided that it is sufficient enough for prototyping and testing
        purposes, since the link between the keys and servo should not be load bearing.<br>The design is nearly
        complete, and will be integrated with the existing docking adapter to be assembled and mounted on the drone,
        with the shape will be very similar to the one seen on the testing docking mount.<br>Lastly, a new testing
        structure was designed and constructed for progressing testing from a 2 drone test shown before onto a 4 drone
        test to ensure that the control scheme developed by the Controls team will be stable at a scale similar to that
        of the final frame at the 8 drone scale.<br>
        <div style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/aviata/4-drone-system.png" style="width: 40%;" /></div><br>This new
        testing structure utilizes the same square carbon fiber tubes that will be on the final prototype frame, and
        utilizes 3D printed clamping structures to hold the drones and tubes together. Here's a closer look at the rigid
        clamp mounts designed on a drone and the central structure:<br>
        <div style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/aviata/4-drone-system-close.png" style="width: 40%;" /></div><br>This
        testing structure is already underway in fabrication, and should expect to see the first test flight soon before
        the end of the quarter!<br>

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <h3>Author: Ryan Nemiroff</h3>
    <div class="autogen-md">To start off the software section, we want to announce that we have made our code repository
        public. We are passionate about sharing as many resources as possible with the world, so feel free to check it
        out at <a href="https://github.com/uas-at-ucla/aviata">github.com/uas-at-ucla/aviata</a>.<br>In the last update
        (on 4/30) we showed a milestone test that demonstrated the effectiveness of the canted motors in enabling yaw
        control, as well as a handoff of the leadership role from one drone to the other in flight. At this point, the
        code had also included modifications that stopped the drones from fighting each other due to yaw “disagreements”
        that might be caused by typical hardware imperfections such as misaligned compasses. This further aided yaw
        control.<br>One notable result from the last test was the dip in altitude when the drones switched
        leader/follower roles. This has to do with the fact that we are relying on the PX4 flight software to estimate
        the thrust required to hover, but the follower drone is not in a mode that actively estimates this hover thrust.
        When it becomes the leader, it takes a moment to determine the necessary amount of thrust. The easiest way to
        fix this was to simply tweak PX4 so that it actively estimates the hover thrust at all times. Very soon, we'll
        be able to test how effective this is.<br>Something we <i>have</i> tested is the ability of the drones to fly
        cooperatively while facing different directions (e.g. north, south, east, west) relative to each other. This
        requires live adjustments to the attitude setpoints to transform them to the correct coordinate frame. If we
        have done this correctly, there won't be any effect on the frame's maneuverability. Luckily, the test was
        successful and that's exactly what we observed. Specifically, we tested the same 2-drone setup, but with one
        drone rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise around the yaw axis -- in other words, it's facing a little to the
        left. This is a precursor to the final frame design in which all 8 drones will be facing radially
        outward.<br>Additionally, we have reached a huge milestone by using mesh networking (OLSRv2) for communication
        in flight. This will be important when scaling up to more than 2 drones, because a mesh network will offer the
        greatest flexibility in distributing information among a swarm of drones with no designated access point. While
        we have been working on mesh networking for a while, we just now figured out how to integrate it with the flight
        code, which uses ROS2 to communicate. The challenge was configuring ROS2 (specifically, it's Fast-DDS
        middleware), to operate within the constraints of the mesh network, which does not support multicast. This
        required reading and re-reading much of the Fast-DDS documentation until we understood it well enough to make
        our desired configuration. In the future, we are interested in implementing multicast and/or broadcast on the
        mesh network, because this will allow ROS2 nodes to automatically discover each other, as they do on normal
        networks.<br>Recently, I've been hard at work prepping hardware for the upcoming 4-drone test. There are a lot
        of little details and repetitive tasks that take time, so it's not much to talk about. A couple important next
        steps will be fleshing out a graphical ground control station so it is easier to manage the increased number of
        drones, and analyzing the modeled behavior in the Python simulator before trying out the real thing.<br>Below is
        a preview of what the 4-drone test will look like, in my ridiculously messy garage. It's big!<br><img

        crowdfunding donors who named them. See who they are at <a
