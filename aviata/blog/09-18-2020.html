    <h1>Update #1: September 18, 2020 </h1>
    <div class="autogen-md">When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the US and stay-at-home orders began, we at UAS@UCLA learned
        that we wouldn't get the chance to fly our brand-new UAV at the annual AUVSI-SUAS competition in Maryland this
        year. This left us with a lot of time on our hands and not much to show for our work this school
        year.<br>Fortunately, we were informed of a little-known NASA research grant for undergraduate students, called
        the University Student Research Challenge (USRC). The onus is on the students to come up with a research topic
        that aligns with NASA's mission, and to then draft a research proposal for it. Our topic? AVIATA - the
        Autonomous Vehicle Infinite Flight Time Apparatus. We plan to build a swarm of drones that's able to collaborate
        together to carry heavy items for an infinite amount of time by innovatively swapping charged and discharged
        drones in and out of the swarm.<br>Fast-forward to July 2020. NASA reached out to us and let us know we had been
        selected to receive grant money to fund our project! Riding on the heels of this fantastic news, we launched a
        successful crowdfunding campaign as required by the USRC, which unlocked access to more of NASA's pledged grant
        money, and today we are in the initial stages of project design and planning.<br></div>
    <h2>Software Design</h2>
    <h3>Author: Axel Malahieude</h3>
    <div class="autogen-md">Firstly, it was important to determine what the software team would be responsible for.
        While we have a hardware team designing the mechanical aspects of AVIATA, the software team would be in charge
        of creating the control systems. This means figuring out how to make several drones fly together, how to
        communicate with the drone swarm, and how to autonomously dock and undock from the structure while in
        flight.<br>In the design stage, we are having high-level discussions on how these processes will work.
        Currently, this involves a lot of flow-charting and “what if” conversations to make sure we handle all possible
        scenarios. For example, what if a drone flies to the structure to replace another drone, but it's unable to find
        it's docking location?<br>Another software-oriented goal is to develop simulation capabilities. One of our
        engineers, Ryan, has successfully created a Python program that can model how the drone swarm would react if a
        drone were to leave. This is important because it will allow us to predict the minimum number and configuration
        of drones we need based on the current weight we're carrying. So far, the results are very promising, and we'll
        continue to develop this simulator.<br>The goal for the upcoming weeks is to fully flesh out what AVIATA will
        look like from a software perspective. We have a preliminary design review planned for mid-October, where we
        hope to get constructive feedback on our current design. Afterwards, we'll be ready to start writing code and
        programming the drones.<br></div>
    <h2>Hardware Design</h2>
    <h3>Author: Bhrugu Mallajosyula</h3>
    <div class="autogen-md">As you might imagine, developing a collaborative drone swarm for lifting objects involves a
        whole host of technical challenges, both mechanical and in software, that need to be dealt with to produce a
        robust final product. The hardware team's job is to design the fixtures and mechanisms that help this type of
        interdrone collaboration run smoothly, and to make the software team's job easier by reducing the mechanical
        uncertainties that make communication and control more difficult.<br>The hardware team focuses on three main
        areas of development: a frame to which the payload is secured, the docking mechanism that facilitates the
        drones' attachment to and detachment from the frame, and modifications to existing drones so that they function
        as desired within our system. Though Covid-19 related restrictions make it difficult for team members to meet in
        person, we've developed a plan for distributing manpower and resources between each of these areas so that we
        can make steady progress even without in person meetings for the foreseeable future.<br>The hardware team is
        already hard at work researching, prototyping, and designing the components to make our system run smoothly. For
        development of the frame, one of our engineers, Willy, has determined the weight budget for the frame and
        payload by calculating the thrust produced by only three drones flying in suboptimal conditions. Another
        engineer, James, is researching ways to reduce oscillation and vibration of the payload, by damping or other
        means, to reduce the corrections that need to be made during flight in software.<br>For the docking mechanism,
        I've been testing a series of 3D printed fixtures that attach to either the frame or a swarm drone to help
        magnetically align the drones in the proper orientation for attachment. Progress on all fronts has been smooth
        and continual so far.<br>Over the next few weeks the hardware team plans to finalize our preliminary design and
        test subassemblies individually before moving to the next stage of development. We hope to test the docking
        mechanism using a human-piloted hexacopter before our preliminary design review in mid-October, where UCLA
        faculty and industry experts will give us feedback on our developments up until that point. We're very excited
        about this project and our progress, and hope you'll stick around with us on this journey.<br></div>
